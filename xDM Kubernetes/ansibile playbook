This playbook assumes that you have already configured your target VM as an Ansible host, 
and have SSH access to it with a user account that has sudo permissions. 
You should replace your_vm_hostname with the hostname or IP address of your target VM.

Save the above code to a file with the .yml extension (e.g. deploy_semarchy.yml), and run it with the following command:

Copy code
ansible-playbook deploy_semarchy.yml
This will execute the playbook and perform the necessary steps on your target VM.
